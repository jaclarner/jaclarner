          subtitle: "Croeso! Welcome! I'm Jac and I'm an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Cardiff University. I am a Co-Investigator on the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded Welsh Election Study, and a research fellow on the ESRC funded Scottish Election Study.<br><br>
    
    My research uses a political psychology framework and survey data to answer questions about political behaviour and public opinion. Some of this work has been published in peer-reviewed journals including the *British Journal of Political Science*, *Political Psychology*, *Political Behavior*, and the *Journal of Experimental Research*. I'm a firm believer in the importance of making this research accessible to the public, and am a frequent media contributor.<br><br>
    
    At Cardiff I am affiliated with the Wales Governance Centre, and through my work with the Scottish Election Study I am a Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh. Previously, I was a Fulbright Fellow at the University of Michigan's Center for Political Studies (Institute for Social Research). My research is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and the British Academy/Leverhulme Trust."
