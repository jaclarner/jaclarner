### Publications, Working Papers, and Works in Progress

----

#### Research Overview
> <p style="font-size: 0.8em;"> 
  
I conduct research in public opinion, political psychology, and political behavior in the United Kingdom and other advanced democracies. My work examines how identities and values shape political attitudes and electoral choices across three interconnected research streams:

## National Identity and Electoral Behaviour

As an Investigator with the Welsh and Scottish Election Studies, I investigate how national identity interacts with other social identities and value systems to influence voting behavior and policy preferences. This work provides insights into the dynamics of multi-level governance and the political consequences of devolution in the UK.

## Disability and Political Psychology

I examine how disability status shapes political identity formation, policy attitudes, and support for redistribution. This research challenges conventional assumptions about disability politics by demonstrating how perceptions of deservingness condition public support for welfare programs, even for stereotypically "deserving" groups like people with disabilities.

## Candidate Authenticity

Working with colleagues, I have developed new measures to assess perceived candidate authenticity and its influence on voter decision-making. The goal here is to advance our understanding of how non-policy factors affect electoral outcomes in contemporary democracies.

### National Identity and Electoral Behaviour

- **Political Scandals and Vertical Contagion in Multilevel Systems** <br>
  *British Journal of Political Science*, (Forthcoming). With Rob Jonns, Ailsa Henderson, Fraser McMillan and Christopher Carman. <br>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p style="font-size: 0.9em;"> Can a scandal in one political sphere tarnish—or unexpectedly polish—the reputation of leaders and
politicians in another? This study investigates the impact of political scandals in multi-level political systems
and explores three possibilities: *contagion*, where trust erodes across all political levels; *containment*, where
evaluations are limited to the specific institutions involved; and *contrast*, where actors at other levels appear
more trustworthy in comparison. This paper presents the first experimental test of vertical contagion,
containment, and contrast effects following real-world scandals in UK and Scottish politics: Partygate and
Campervangate. We find weak evidence of contagion in the Scottish-level ‘Campervangate’ scandal, al-
though trust reductions were generally small and often not statistically significant. However, the ‘Partygate’
scandal reveals a distinct contrast effect: trust decreased in UK political actors but increased at the Scottish
level. These results suggest that scandals in multi-level polities can influence evaluations of otherwise
‘innocent’ political actors with troubling consequences for democratic accountability mechanisms. </p>

- **Diverging electoral fortunes in Scotland and Wales: national identities, national interests, and voting behavior** <br>
  *Regional & Federal Studies*, (2022) with James Griffiths, Richard Wyn Jones, Ed Gareth Poole, Ailsa Hendersn and Fraser McMillan. <br> 

[Paper](https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/160448/8/Diverging%20electoral%20fortunes%20in%20Scotland%20and%20Wales%20national%20identities%20national%20interests%20and%20voting%20behavior.pdf) | 
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p style="font-size: 0.9em;"> Despite an extraordinary degree of political turbulence in the UK, the 2021
Scottish and Welsh election results were remarkably similar to those recorded
at the previous elections in 2016. While this period spanned the 2016 EU
referendum, Britain’s exit from the EU, and the coronavirus pandemic, these
upheavals appear to have had little impact on devolved election results.
From a comparative perspective, however, such continuity only underlines
the extent to which these nations’ political trajectories have diverged since
the establishment of devolution in 1999. Using individual-level survey data
from twelve election studies over two decades, we show how changing
patterns in the relationship between national identity and party support have
driven these di ering trajectories. In doing so, we provide the rst
comparative analysis of voting over time in both countries. Additionally, we
show how national identity helps to sustain single-party dominance in
Scotland and Wales. </p>
