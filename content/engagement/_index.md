# Media & Engagement

I believe that meaningful public engagement is essential for bridging the gap between academic research and society. Through media appearances, public lectures, and digital tools, I strive to make political analysis accessible and relevant to diverse audiences. I welcome opportunities for collaboration and am always happy to be contacted for media inquiries or speaking engagements.
